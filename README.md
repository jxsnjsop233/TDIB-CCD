# Graduation Project

*usage*

1. Enter the directory of xmake.lua

2. Run Command

```
xmake
```

3. Run the experiment

```
xmake run scene ...[args]
```

4. Example

```
xmake run scene -s td -e rand -b obb -d 1e-3 -k 1000 -n 1
```

### Run experiments
```
xmake run scene
```
Optional arguments:
```
-s    Type of CCD solver. Use "trad" for the traditional method, or "td" for our time-dependent method.
-e    Type of experiment. Use "rand" for the random test, "single" for the single test, or "bunny" for the bunny-torus test.
-b    Type of inclusions. Use "aabb" for AABB, or "obb" for OBB.
-d    Precision requirement, i.e., maximum width of the parametric interval.
-k    Number of generated cases. Only used in the "rand" experiment.
-n    Usage of NVIDIA GPU to calculation (0/1). Only used in the "rand" experiment.
```

**The default setting is**
```
xmake run scene -s td -e rand -b obb -d 1e-5 -k 100 -n 0
```

# TDIB-CCD
This is the official implementation of [A Time-Dependent Inclusion-Based Method for Continuous Collision Detection between Parametric Surfaces](https://xw-c.github.io/publication/siga24/) (accepted as SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Journal Paper).

## Content
### Structure
We have provided the core code for CCD between parametric surfaces in the `./core` folder, including implementation of geometric primitives, CCD solvers, and some auxiliary functions. Different test scenarios are set in the `./scene` folder.

Also, we have provided a denegerate version of CCD methods for EE tests and VF tests between linear triangle meshes in the `./benchmark` folder of the `benchmark` branch.

### CCD solver
We have implemented the traditional inclusion-based method (described in Section 3) and our proposed time-dependent inclusion-based method (described in Section 4). Both methods can adopt AABB or OBB as the inclusion type.

### Geometric primitives
CCD methods between parametric surfaces have been tested on different geometric primitives, including triangular patches and rectangular patches of 1st/2nd/3rd order. Each patch is represented by a list of control points. Taking third-order patches as an example, we illustrate the order below. 
- Each control point of an rectangular patch of order $n$ is denoted by 2 integers indicating its position on the $(u,v)$ grid.
- Each control point of an triangular patch of order $n$ is denoted by 3 integers, which add up to $n$, indicating its position on the $(u,v,w)$ grid.

### Test scenarios
This repository has contained 3 experiments for CCD between parametric surfaces.
- Single test. We manually design a simple case to show how to use the CCD solver.
- Random test. It randomly generates a number of CCD cases between third-order rectangular patches and report the average time consumption. The geometric primitive can be changed by editing the template parameters in the `main` function.
- Bunny-torus test (Figure 2). CCD is applied between 2 multi-patch objects. Both the bunny and the torus undergo imitated rigid-body motions.

Additionally, it includes one experiment for EE/VF tests in the `benchmark` branch. This experiment evaluates CCD solvers on the large-scale benchmark released by [CCD-Wrapper](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/CCD-Wrapper).

## Usage
### Install
- Install [xmake](https://xmake.io/). 
- Run the following lines to install this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/xw-c/TDIB-CCD.git
cd TDIB-CCD
xmake
```
### Run experiments
```
xmake run scene
```
Optional arguments:
```
-s    Type of CCD solver. Use "trad" for the traditional method, or "td" for our time-dependent method.
-e    Type of experiment. Use "rand" for the random test, "single" for the single test, or "bunny" for the bunny-torus test.
-b    Type of inclusions. Use "aabb" for AABB, or "obb" for OBB.
-d    Precision requirement, i.e., maximum width of the parametric interval.
-k    Number of generated cases. Only used in the "rand" experiment.
```
The default setting is
```
xmake run scene -s td -e rand -b obb -d 1e-5 -k 100
```
Put the `./scene/bunny292.obj` file under the same folder as `scene.exe` before you run the bunny-torus test.

To build the experiment for EE/VF tests, checkout to the `benchmark` branch, follow the instructions on [CCD-Wrapper](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/CCD-Wrapper), and use similar commands to install and run it.
